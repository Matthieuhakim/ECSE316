# Assignment 2: Fast Fourier Transform
Program was written and tested using python version 3.10.7
### To run the project, execute with the following syntax:
python fft.py [-m mode] [-i image] <br /> <br />
Where the arguments are defined as follows:
- **mode**(optional): <br />
[1] (Default) for fast mode where the image is converted into its FFT form and displayed <br />
[2] for denoising where the image is denoised by applying an FFT, truncating high frequencies and then displayed <br />
[3] for compressing and saving the image <br />
[4] for plotting the runtime graphs for the report <br />
- **image**(optional): <br />
filename of the image we wish to take the DFT of. (Default: moonlanding.png)
